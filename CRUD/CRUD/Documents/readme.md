Database Description:
	The database is a representation of a company that produces kool aid. It has multiple buildings, within each are
	reactors that they use to perform the production of kool aid. The reactors are filled by processes that use a 
	standard set of reactants to produce kool aid. Each kind of kool aid has a different set of reactants.

	SQLite was selected because it is a fairly common standard with good support. It integrates well with C#/VS2022.
